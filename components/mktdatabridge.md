## What It Does

MktDataBridge serves as the **critical market data backbone** for the Stream Systems platform, providing real-time acquisition, processing, and distribution of market data from Bloomberg Terminal and other sources. This component ensures all pricing and trading systems have access to high-quality, low-latency market data.

### Core Business Functions

<div class="content-section" markdown="1">

#### üìä **Market Data Acquisition**
- **Bloomberg Terminal Integration**: Real-time data via BLPAPI 3.16.1-2
- **Multi-Source Support**: Thomson Reuters and other market data vendors
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive quality checks and filtering
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Redundant data sources for reliability

#### ‚ö° **High-Performance Processing**
- **LMAX Disruptor**: Low-latency event processing architecture
- **Hazelcast Clustering**: Distributed caching for scalability
- **Real-Time Distribution**: Sub-second data propagation
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Efficient message processing patterns

## Current Status & Health

### ‚úÖ **Production Strengths**

{: .highlight-box }
**Reliable Data Processing**: MktDataBridge successfully handles **real-time market data** with robust **Bloomberg integration** and **enterprise messaging**.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Bloomberg Integration**: Comprehensive BLPAPI wrapper with session management
- **High-Performance Processing**: LMAX Disruptor for low-latency data handling
- **Distributed Architecture**: Hazelcast clustering for fault tolerance
- **Enterprise Messaging**: Solace integration for reliable delivery

### üî¥ **Critical Issues Requiring Attention**

{: .financial-data }
**Reliability Risk**: HIGH - Single Bloomberg session dependency and limited failover mechanisms create availability risks.

| Risk Category | Impact | Status | Resolution Timeline |
|---------------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Bloomberg Session Failure** | Critical | Active | 2-3 weeks |
| **Missing Failover Mechanisms** | High | Active | 3-4 weeks |
| **Memory Management Issues** | High | Active | 2-4 weeks |
| **Inadequate Monitoring** | Medium | Active | 2-3 weeks |

### Required Improvements

**üî¥ MUST DO (4-6 weeks | $75K-125K):**
- **Implement Bloomberg Session Failover**: Multiple session support with automatic switching
- **Memory Management**: Fix unbounded map growth and implement cleanup
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Replace aggressive shutdowns with graceful degradation
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive application health indicators

**üü° SHOULD DO (8-12 weeks | $100K-150K):**
- **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling and async processing
- **Monitoring Enhancement**: Real-time metrics and alerting
- **Cluster Resilience**: Multi-master configurations and split-brain protection
